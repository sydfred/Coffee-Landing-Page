            This is probably the common way to brew coffee in the world. This is
            the method used in every diner, caf√©, and restaurant. It‚Äôs the
            method your grandmother used. Coffee is ground at medium-coarseness
            and placed in a brewing machine. There are variants in the machines
            used to brew drip coffee. Some of the more advanced ones will
            pre-wet the grinds to allow some of the gases to release before the
            rest of the water is poured on.

            French press is an easy to operate machine used to make coffee.The
            coffee it can make is stronger than that produced by other means. A
            French press has a round jug. This jug can be glass or clear
            plastic. The jug has a lid and a "plunger". The plunger fits in the
            jug very well. It usually has some kind of steel or plastic wire,
            that acts as a filter. Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and
            water together, leaving to brew for a few minutes, then pushing the
            plunger down. This puts the coffee at the bottom of the jug.

            This is one of the most popular ways for making coffee at home. It‚Äôs
            also used in third-wave coffee shops to make single-origin coffee
            for those that are interested in an Ethiopian, Guatemalan, or
            another sort of specific type of coffee. This method is great for
            someone who is starting out making fresh coffee at home and wants to
